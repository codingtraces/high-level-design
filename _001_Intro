High-Level Design (HLD) in simple terms refers to the process of planning and outlining the structure of a system or software before building it. It’s like creating a blueprint or a map that shows the major components, their relationships, and how they interact with each other. Here’s what you need to understand:

1. **Big Picture**: HLD focuses on the overall architecture, showing the major building blocks of the system, like databases, servers, APIs, and how they connect.

2. **Components**: Identify the key components of the system, like the user interface, business logic, data storage, etc.

3. **Interactions**: Explain how these components will interact with each other, which might involve communication protocols, data flow, and integration points.

4. **Technology Stack**: Decide on the technologies and tools that will be used to build the system, like programming languages, frameworks, and databases.

5. **Scalability and Performance**: Consider how the system will handle increased load and maintain performance, which might involve distributed systems, caching, or load balancing.

6. **Security**: Outline how security will be managed, including data protection, user authentication, and access control.

7. **Design Patterns**: Use standard design patterns like MVC (Model-View-Controller) or Microservices to structure your system effectively.

8. **Modularity**: Ensure that the system is modular, meaning it’s divided into separate parts that can be developed, tested, and maintained independently.

In HLD, you don’t go into the nitty-gritty details (like specific algorithms or code); instead, you provide a high-level overview that guides the detailed design and development process later on.
